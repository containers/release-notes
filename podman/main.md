 - The `podman machine stop` command on macOS now waits for the machine to be completely stopped. ([#14666](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/14666), [@shanesmith](https://github.com/shanesmith))
 - The command "podman kube play" replaces the "podman play kube" command.
  "podman play kube" can still be used in the same manner as before as it is now an alias of
  "podman kube play". ([#14772](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/14772), [@nicrowe00](https://github.com/nicrowe00))
 - This fix prevents the OCI runtime directory from remaining. It also prevents other bugs occurring. ([#14720](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/14720), [@sstosh](https://github.com/sstosh))
 - Unused, cached Podman machine VM images are now cleaned up automatically. Note that because we cache in a different dir, this will not clean up old images pulled before this change. ([#14900](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/14900), [@ashley-cui](https://github.com/ashley-cui))
 - Update supported kube fields for configMap and deployment kind in play kube docs ([#14842](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/14842), [@umohnani8](https://github.com/umohnani8))
 - User enables to remove unused networks using podman system prune command. ([#14556](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/14556), [@sstosh](https://github.com/sstosh))
 - Users can now specify the --uts option when creating pods, specifying a pod wide uts mode for all containers. ([#14501](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/14501), [@cdoern](https://github.com/cdoern))
 - Users will be able to see a tangible change when settings resource limits on pods ([#14654](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/14654), [@cdoern](https://github.com/cdoern))
 - `podman auto-update` will now create an event. ([#14292](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/14292), [@vrothberg](https://github.com/vrothberg))
 - `podman machine init --now` now respects the proxy environment variables like `podman machine start`. ([#14665](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/14665), [@Luap99](https://github.com/Luap99))
